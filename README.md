Overview:

This module is part of the 42 Network C++ curriculum, aimed at introducing students to the basics of C++ programming and object-oriented concepts. The focus of this module is on deepening the understanding of C++ syntax, memory management, and the foundational principles of object-oriented design.

Objectives:

Understand and apply object-oriented programming principles: Learn the basics of classes, objects, member functions, and encapsulation in C++.
Memory Management: Gain a basic understanding of memory allocation, scope, and the use of constructors and destructors.
Handling Different Data Types: Work with various data types, including strings, integers, and user-defined types.
Operator Overloading: Learn how to define custom behavior for operators when applied to user-defined types.

Key Topics Covered
Classes and Objects: Define classes and create objects, understanding the use of access specifiers (public, private).
Member Functions: Learn how to define and use member functions, including constructors and destructors.
This Pointer: Understand the this pointer and how it is used in member functions.
Initialization Lists: Learn to use initialization lists in constructors for better performance and clarity.
Static Members: Work with static variables and functions, understanding their lifecycle and scope.
Namespaces: Learn about namespaces to organize code and avoid naming conflicts.
File I/O: Basic file input/output operations for reading and writing data.
Project Structure
The project is structured into several exercises, each focusing on a specific concept:

Exercise 00: Creating basic classes, understanding member functions and access specifiers.
Exercise 01: Expanding on classes with member functions, exploring constructors, and destructors.
Exercise 02: Introduction to namespaces and static members.
Exercise 03: Overloading operators to provide custom behavior for your classes.
Exercise 04: Working with file input/output, managing data read/write operations.
